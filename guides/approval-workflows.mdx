## Overview

Approval workflows ensure proper authorization for financial documents. This guide covers workflow configuration and best practices.

## Creating a Workflow

### Step 1: Define Conditions

Specify when this workflow applies:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {"field": "document_type", "operator": "eq", "value": "invoice"},
    {"field": "amount", "operator": "gt", "value": 1000}
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Add Approval Steps

Configure who needs to approve:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Manager Approval",
      "approvers": {
        "type": "role",
        "value": "cost_center_manager"
      },
      "threshold": "any_one"
    },
    {
      "name": "Finance Review",
      "approvers": {
        "type": "group",
        "value": "finance_team"
      },
      "threshold": "any_one"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Set Escalation Rules

Configure automatic escalation:

```json
{
  "escalation": {
    "after_hours": 48,
    "escalate_to": "department_head",
    "notify": true
  }
}
```

## Approver Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `user` | Specific user by ID |
| `role` | Users with a specific role |
| `group` | Members of a group |
| `hierarchy` | User's manager/supervisor |

## Threshold Options

- `any_one` - Single approver sufficient
- `all` - All approvers must approve
- `majority` - More than 50% must approve

## Delegation

Users can delegate their approval authority:

1. Go to **Settings > Delegation**
2. Select delegate user
3. Set date range
4. Choose scope (all or specific)
