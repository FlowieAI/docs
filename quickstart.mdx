## Overview

This guide will help you make your first API call to Flowie. By the end, you'll be able to:
- Authenticate with the API
- List your invoices
- Create a new invoice

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- A Flowie account with API access
- Your Auth0 credentials (client ID and secret)

## Step 1: Get an Access Token

Flowie uses Auth0 for authentication. Request a token using your credentials:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://flowie.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "audience": "https://auth.flowieapp.com",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials"
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
```

<Note>
  Store your access token securely. It expires after 24 hours.
</Note>

## Step 2: Make Your First API Call

Use your token to list invoices:

```bash
curl https://back.flowieapp.com/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "inv_abc123",
      "number": "INV-2024-001",
      "supplier": "Acme Corp",
      "amount": 1500.00,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "status": "pending_approval"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create an Invoice

Create a new invoice via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://back.flowieapp.com/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "number": "INV-2024-002",
    "supplier_id": "sup_xyz789",
    "amount": 2500.00,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "invoice_date": "2024-01-15",
    "due_date": "2024-02-15"
  }'
```
