## Overview

Workflows define the approval process for documents in Flowie. They can be configured with multiple steps, conditions, and approvers.

## Workflow Components

### Steps
Sequential approval stages with:
- Approvers (users, roles, or groups)
- Approval threshold (any one, all, or majority)
- Auto-escalation rules

### Conditions
Rules that determine which workflow applies:
- Amount thresholds
- Document type
- Supplier category
- Cost center

### Actions
What happens at each step:
- Approve / Reject
- Request changes
- Delegate to another user

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: "Invoice Approval"
conditions:
  - document_type: invoice
triggers:
  - amount > 0
steps:
  - name: "Manager Approval"
    approvers:
      type: role
      value: "cost_center_manager"
    threshold: any_one
    conditions:
      - amount < 5000
  - name: "Director Approval"
    approvers:
      type: role  
      value: "department_director"
    threshold: any_one
    conditions:
      - amount >= 5000
  - name: "Finance Review"
    approvers:
      type: group
      value: "finance_team"
    threshold: any_one
```

## Delegation

Users can delegate their approval authority:
- Temporary (vacation, leave)
- Permanent (role change)
- Conditional (specific suppliers or amounts)
