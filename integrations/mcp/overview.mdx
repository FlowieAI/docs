## Overview

Flowie provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable AI tools like Claude, Cursor, and others to interact directly with your Flowie data.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that allows AI assistants to access external data sources and tools in a standardized way. With Flowie's MCP servers, you can:

- Query invoices and POs using natural language
- Create and update records through AI assistants
- Get real-time budget information
- Manage tags and custom fields

## Installation

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.config/claude/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "flowie": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@flowie/mcp-server"],
        "env": {
          "FLOWIE_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "flowie": {
      "command": "npx @flowie/mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "FLOWIE_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Endpoint

Flowie's MCP endpoint is available at:

```
https://flowie.mintlify.app/mcp
```

## Example Prompts

Once configured, you can use prompts like:

- "Show me all pending invoices"
- "Create a new purchase order for office supplies"
- "What's the remaining budget for Marketing?"
- "Tag invoice INV-2024-001 as urgent"

## Security

MCP servers use the same API authentication as the REST API. Your API token determines what operations are permitted.
