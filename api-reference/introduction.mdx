    A[Upload File] --> B[OCR Processing]
    B --> C[Data Extraction]
    C --> D[Validation]
    D --> E[Structured Invoice]
```

1. **Upload** - Send any invoice file to the Documents API
2. **Process** - Flowie runs OCR and AI extraction
3. **Extract** - Structured data is extracted (vendor, amounts, line items)
4. **Validate** - Data is validated and matched against your suppliers
5. **Ready** - Invoice is ready for approval workflows

## Base URL

All API requests use the main gateway:

```
https://back.flowieapp.com
```

## Service Endpoints

| Service | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Documents** | `/doc` | Upload and manage invoice files |
| **Invoices** | `/invoices` | Access processed invoice data |
| **Organizations** | `/organizations` | Organization and business units |
| **Budget** | `/budget` | Budget tracking and allocation |
| **Purchase** | `/purchase` | Purchase orders for matching |
| **Tags** | `/tag` | Categorization and coding |

## Quick Start: Upload an Invoice

```bash
# Upload an invoice file
curl -X POST https://back.flowieapp.com/doc/organizations/{org_id}/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@invoice.pdf" \
  -F "name=Invoice_2024_001.pdf"
```

The document will be automatically processed:
- **OCR** extracts text from images/scans
- **AI** identifies invoice fields (vendor, date, amount, lines)
- **Matching** links to existing suppliers and POs

## Check Processing Status

```bash
# Get document with OCR status
curl https://back.flowieapp.com/doc/organizations/{org_id}/documents/{doc_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "doc_xyz789",
    "name": "Invoice_2024_001.pdf",
    "status": "active",
    "ocrStatus": "completed",

      "totalAmount": 1500.00,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieve Processed Invoice

Once processed, access the structured invoice:

```bash
curl https://back.flowieapp.com/invoices/{invoice_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://back.flowieapp.com/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

See [Authentication](/authentication) for obtaining tokens via OAuth 2.0.
